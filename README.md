# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📖 Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset of patient health indicators. The aim is to demonstrate logistic regression techniques for binary classification.

## 🗄 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Heart Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
- **Features:** Age, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, Chest Pain Type, etc.
- **Target:** Presence or absence of heart disease (binary).

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand feature distribution, correlations, and missing values.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handling nulls, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
3. **Model Building:** Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning.  
4. **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC Curve.  

## 📊 Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **86%** with logistic regression.  
- Precision: **53%**, Recall: **69%**, and an F1-score of **52**.  
- Visualized insights using matplotlib and seaborn.  

## 🚀 How to Run
